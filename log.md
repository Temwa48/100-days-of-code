**Today's Progress**: Spent the day programming projects

**Thoughts:** I planned to read chapters and complete some Sololearn lessons but I didn't get to it because the project took more time than expected. Still proud that I completed it

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapters 3 - 6 of C All-in-One Desk Reference, Boook I and completed Lessons 8 - 11 of Sololearn

**Thoughts:** I missed the last two days so I'm in catch-up mode. It was a lot of information but I think that I've got it all in. After I complete Book I, I'll start looking into starting projects (so from next week)
